Sentiment Analysis Project
This project provides a multi-model sentiment analysis pipeline that leverages several popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries and models to analyze the sentiment and emotional context of text. It uses NLTK, TextBlob, Flair, and DeepMoji for sentiment classification and emoji-based emotional inference.

Features
NLTK (Vader): Analyzes text and returns sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral).
TextBlob: Provides polarity (sentiment) and subjectivity analysis.
Flair: Returns a sentence-level sentiment label (positive or negative).
DeepMoji: Predicts emojis representing the emotional tone of the input text.
Setup
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install directly:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk textblob flair torch==1.0.1 emoji seaborn
Run inference on a sample sentence:

bash
Copy code
python inference.py
Usage
Edit the inference.py file to test different sentences or use the provided analyze_sentiment() function to process your own text.
